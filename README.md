# tip-calculator

Coding Bootcamp Challenge

## Rules and Guideline to the Challenge

Your task is to create a simple command-line (Node, Python or other) or front-end JavaScript application that will help calculate a tip at a restaurant for your server. No boilerplate code
will be provided, so you are free to construct this however you would like. However, your application must:

- Take in the value of the bill
- Take in the desired tip percentage
- Include the option to split the tip amount by number of people at the table
- The application should then calculate the amount of tip per table (or per person if the split option is chosen) and return that value to the user.

#### BONUS:

- Create a simple UI so that this can be used in a browser
- Deploy to your favorite hosting service (Heroku, Netlify, etc.)

# Development Notes

#### Libraries

- jQuery for quick and easy scripting
- font-awesome (which is now a library) for icons
- google fonts for styling
